# Inertial Measurment Unit
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lobodol/IMU.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lobodol/IMU)

This Arduino sketch is about measuring angles on 3 orthogonal axis using the [MPU6050 sensor](https://www.invensense.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Datasheet1.pdf).

Basically, it calculates angles using both gyro data & accelerometer data.

A detailed article will come very soon (work in progress).
